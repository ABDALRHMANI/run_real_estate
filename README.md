# Steps We Took to Build the Site:

### Data Collection and Web Scraping
We built this site by collecting data from the Property Finder website using web scraping with the Beautiful Soup library.

### Data Processing
- **Hidden Details Extraction**: 
  - Some listings do not advertise the down payment directly but mention it in the description.
  - Similarly, the number of years for installments might only be in the description.
  - Some listings only show the down payment as the price and include the real price in the description.
- **Regular Expressions**: 
  - We used regular expressions (regex) to find and extract these details accurately.

### Data Analysis and Visualization
- **Data Analysis**: 
  - We analyzed the cleaned and processed data to understand key insights and trends.
- **Best Visualization Selection**: 
  - We chose the best visualization methods to display the data effectively.
- **Dash Library**: 
  - We used the Dash library to create an interactive dashboard that presents the information in a user-friendly and informative manner.
